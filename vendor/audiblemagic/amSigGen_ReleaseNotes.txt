RELEASE NOTES
Audible Magic Signature Generator (amSigGen) for Windows and Linux
March 13, 2012

Release 7.5

1. Fixed bug from 7.4 where untested multichannel (surround-sound) formats were mistakenly accepted.
In 7.5, 5.1 AAC in video files are accepted. On Windows, multichannel WMA files are also accepted.
Earlier releases should not be used to process multichannel files; in some cases these produce fingerprints 
that will result in false negative identifications.

================================================
Release 7.4

1. Fixed bug to support files containing 5.1 (surround sound) AAC audio.

================================================

Release 7.3

1. Release for submitted-content (custom database) customers, including new signature format (.mfcc) .

================================================

Release 7.2 (Windows only)

For installation and usage instructions, see 
"Teaming Up With Audible Magic - Content Registration.pdf," Appendix A.

There was no official release numbered 7.0 or 7.1.

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.9 to amSigGen 7.2

1. New signature format (.mfcc), replacing .am3.

2. Fixed bug where files containing 24- or 32-bit PCM audio (or a compressed
format that should decode to either of those formats) were not fingerprinted correctly.
(16-bit audio, as in CD quality, was fine.)

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.9 to amSigGen 6.9a and 7.2
------------------------------------------------

1. added new option (-S) to CLI which will create an XML containing an
audio signature for submitted-content customers.

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.8b to amSigGen 6.9
------------------------------------------------

1. The major changes is that amSigGen will now have access to newer
versions of the ffmpeg libraries.  There were some media files that
caused ffmpeg libraries to crash in AMr12 (e.g. some HD .mov files).


================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.8a to amSigGen 6.8b:
------------------------------------------------

1. Changed behavior described in point 3 under "Changes from amSigGen 
6.5 to amSigGen 6.8" below.  Output signature filenames again have the
same format as prior to 6.8.  The filenames are not necessarily unique,
and (unlike in earlier releases) pre-existing signature files of the 
same name will be overwritten.  (A warning is issued indicating this
is happening, but overwriting proceeds.  This behavior helps ensure that
the most recent version of the signature accompanies the manifest file.)

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.8 to amSigGen 6.8a:
------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed a bug, introduced in 6.8, where the manifest files created by
amSigGen were considered by some software to be incorrect XML.

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.5 to amSigGen 6.8:
------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed a bug causing bad signatures when multiple copies of amSigGen
were run concurrently to process Windows Media files.  It is now OK
to run multiple copies of the executable at the same time.

2. Fixed a bug where amSigGen could not be invoked from outside the
directory (folder) containing the executable itself.

3. Fixed a bug where the manifest file could refer to signature 
files from an earlier run of amSigGen.  Output signature filenames are now
always unique and have a new format.  (For more information, see 
"Signature Filenames" in Appendix A of the document 
"Teaming Up With Audible Magic - Content Registration.pdf.")

4. Various improvements in the underlying functions for processing
audio and video data.

5. The README files have been removed and their information moved into
the document "Teaming Up With Audible Magic - Content Registration.pdf."
The PDF file now has a table of contents and other improvements, including
updated metadata examples (with a new one for a TV show).

6. A new, superior MP3 decoder is being used.

7. The -M option (don't write a manifest file) has been removed from amSigGen.

8. amSigGen no longer produces a manifest file when -x is specified. 

9. Manifest files are now read-only.

10. Two new DLLs are supplied for Windows: libiconv2.dll and libcharset1.dll.
(On Linux, these libraries are not used and so are not supplied.)


================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.1a to amSigGen 6.5:
------------------------------------------------

ffmpeg AMr12 fixes a problem where certain WAV files couldn't be fingerprinted.
(In amSigGen 5.3, the amSigGen error was "Can't access audio samples in this file."  
In amSigGen 6.1a, it was "Unsupported media file."  In both cases, the ffmpeg
executable would get a segmentation fault when asked to read the WAV file.)

Fixed a bug where running amSigGen without -o and specifying an input file
in a read-only directory could cause a crash.

Fixed a bug, seen with input media files of type FLAC, where the generated signature
was too short.

Numerous other improvements in mfcbr_client.dll (windows) and ffmpeg to fix various
bugs in handling problem media files, including certain Windows Media and FLV files.

Files containing multiple video streams result in multiple signature files, just as 
is the case for multiple audio streams.  (Previously, only one video stream was 
fingerprinted.)

Various documentation improvements.

Known bug:  Some media files containing AAC audio may be unsupported.

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 6.1 to amSigGen 6.1a:
------------------------------------------------

In addition to the previously supported formats, amSigGen 6.1a can decode 
and fingerprint media files containing streams in H.264 and SVQ3 formats.

================================================
Changes from amSigGen 5.3j to amSigGen 6.1:
------------------------------------------------

The installation package is a gzip'ped tar file.  This preserves symbolic
links on the Linux system.  If you intend to run the software on 
Linux, you should unpack it on Linux.  If you are planning to run the software
on Windows, or for any reason you decide to unpack it on Windows, you may see 
warnings from your Windows archive extraction application regarding "missing symlinks".  
These warnings are harmless and have no affect on the Windows-specific amSigGen 
executable or its supporting files.

Video signatures (fingerprints of the visual data in the video track of a video file) 
are generated using integrated third-party technology.

The video-fingerprinting library vss1.dll is supplied for win32.
This library is also included in the linux_XXbit subfolders and is called
libvss1.so, where "XX" is either "32" or "64".

Video input files result in fingerprints with the extension .amvs (not .amvfp).

Characters in the input media filename and output path (see -i and -o flags) are no 
longer restricted to letters, numbers, and underscores.

amSigGen now generates a manifest file, which must be submitted to Audible Magic 
along with the signature file(s).   See amSigGen_readme.txt.

A new tool called parseManifests.exe is supplied.  It is run by amSigGenFolder 
(on Windows only) and summarizes errors in a batch run.

Video files containing multiple audio streams (such as soundtracks in different languages) 
will have a separate fingerprint file created for each audio stream.  These multiple
audio fingerprint files will have names ending with _aXX.am3, where XX is a unique 
two-digit number such as 00 or 01.

New -m option to specify a metadata file.

New -x option to get info about the input media file's format and then exit.

If audio signature generation fails, amSigGen will still attempt to generate a video signature.

Better support for files greater than 2GB in size.

DRM'd Windows Media files are always reported as such and never fingerprinted. 

Improved error reporting.
